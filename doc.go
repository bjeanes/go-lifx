/*
A set of libraries and commands for working with LIFX's wifi-enabled light bulbs.

See the following sub-packages for more details:

• Protocol - Encoding/decoding of LIFX messages and transmission/reception
of such.

• Client - Higher-level abstractions ("light bulb", "label", "colors",
etc.) and actions ("set label", "set lights to a specific colour", etc.).

• CLI Tools - These are foremost examples of using the Client and/or
Protocol components but also serve as debugging tools and command line
control over bulbs (e.g. from Bash scripts).
